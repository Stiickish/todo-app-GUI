# todo-app-GUI
Simple todo application made in Python with what I've learned through my Python course at school + some other Python courses. 
This application demonstrates how to make a simple and minimalistic todo app, with a simple GUI, using PySimpleGUI. 
The projects demonstrates how to import modules, how to use built in libraries and also how to import open source libraries. 

You can add, edit and delete todos. The application also shows the current time. 
The application can be run either in terminal/console or with the imported PySimpleGUI. To run only in terminal/console run the script "cli.py".
To run the application with PySimpleGUI run the script "gui.py". 

To use the program, download or clone the projects. Install the requirements needed and then run either script.
